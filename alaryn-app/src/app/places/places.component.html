    <h2 id="panther">Panther's Rest</h2>
    <p>
      Panther's Rest is one of the most influential cities of the region. It was first established by gnomes, but as
      their intention was to create a free city where people of all races could meet. Panther's Rest was built upon
      the ruins of a pirate haven of the post Exodus era. Even though it started as a small trading port it very quickly
      grew, and orcs, dwarves and tieflings alike travelled to the city, be it for diplomacy or looking for a new
      opportunity to settle. Many of the citizens still consider themselves part of their racial empire, but there
      are just as many who have given up their bonds and instead consider themselves fully dedicated to Panther's Rest.
      <br>
      <br>
      Panther's Rest consists of the three smaller islands plus the main land districts. The smallest of the islands
      is a crescent rise, only accessible over water. It would be difficult to climb the steep cliffs of the island and
      the main entrance is always heavily guarded. On top of this crescent cliff is the Captains' Palace where the
      leaders of the city gather when they need to discuss politics or other topics among each other. There are some
      smaller houses and barracks next to the palace where the elite guard resides.The leaders of the city are known
      as the City Captains or just Captains, but these days those titles mostly just remain for historical reasons.
      The second island is closest to the sea. One of the ends of the island rises quite high up and is walled off.
      Inside is the Noble District, where the families of the Captains reside as well as the other richer families and
      people of the city. Outside of the walls is the harbor district. While the mainland districts do have docks too,
      this is where the largest boats and vessels will dock.
      The third island is between the mainland and the second island. It connects to the second island with a bridge
      and to the mainland with two bridges. The island is known as the market district, where merchants and craftsmen of
      all types and qualities can be found. In the center is the grand bazaar which is always filled with hustle and
      bustle.
      The mainland is guarded by a large wall. It connects to the market district on two locations. The northern
      district is the slums. It connects to the market district, but it is always heavily guarded. The slums border
      a large rise which is known as the upper district. The upper district is where most guilds are located, but also
      where the upper middle class lives. Going down from the upper district will connect to the lower district, which
      is the largest of the districts. Right where the upper and lower district meets is the other bridge to the
      market district. The lower district is where most people live.
      <br>
      <br>
      The city is rules by the City Captains of the Captain's Council. The council consists of five members. The first
      member is the gnome Albar Liadon. He is the city's captain of diplomacy and relations and is in charge of keeping
      good relations with the other empires. He is also the head Captain and has the final say should a decision be
      unable to be made by the council.
      <br>
      The second member is the dwarf Eldeth Thrarak. She is the city's captain
      of weapons, armour and equipment. She is in charge of all trade related to armour, arms and other martial
      equipment. She makes sure that the city's guards are well equipped and that all related goods traded with other
      cities are of the highest quality.
      <br>
      The third member is the dwarf Rangrim Stoutale who is the city's captain of guards. He is in charge of training
      the guards of the city, both the regular and elite guards, making sure that the city peace is held and that none
      of the wilderness can threaten the citizens, walls or farms.
      <br>
      The fourth member is the orc Holgur Throkk. He is the city's captain of foods, drinks and trade goods. He must
      make sure that the farms produce enough food for the city and that the fishermen's hauls are bountiful. He is also
      in charge of the trade goods of the city, including drinks, plants, clothes, jewelry and other kinds. He makes
      sure that the city's outgoing goods are of high quality, and that the markets of the city are under control.
      <br>
      The fifth member is the Azzinth Shava Thethren. She is the city's captain of magic and secrets. She is the
      spymaster of the city, but also the overseer of magical items and those who practice crystal arts. Magical
      relics can be dangerous and you need Shava's permission to deal in magical items. She is also the one
      who ensures that no illegal cults using real magic grow within the city.

    <h2 id="saber">Saber's Dawn</h2>
    <p>
      Saber's Dawn is a very recent settlement established by the Captian's Council of Panther's Rest. It was built to
      be a stronghold on the wilderness of the eastern parts of Laronia. The fort is still in the early stages of
      being built, but the Council is urging adventurers to travel there, as those who can bring in valuable information
      from old ruins, find ancient relics or make contact with other civilisations will be generously rewarded.

    <h2 id="dulmon">Dulmon</h2>
    <p>
      Dulmon is the capital of the dwarves. The city is highly technologically advanced, and is the best city to learn
      crystalthurgy. Crystalthurges have enhanced the city's infrastructure, improving communication and travel within
      the city, but they have learnt from history and in case the crystals should fail the city should still be able
      to stand. The city is very hierarchical, and to rise in the ranks the citizens need to show high skills within
      combat, crystalthurgy or craftsmanship.
