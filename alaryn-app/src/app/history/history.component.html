      Early history
    </h2>
    <p>
      A lot of history has been lost about the world. Old records, scrolls and books have allowed the scholars of today
      to piece together some of the events that may have happened in the past, but there is still much uncertainty in
      regards to what is true or not.

      The oldest of records state that the world used to be highly populated with humans and elves. Both were races that
      were blessed by the gods; Humans were blessed with resilience and fertility, and elves were blessed with
      longevity. These blessings allowed them to establish great cities and found large kingdoms and empires, and they
      were naturally gifted with the use of magic which further strengthened their civilisations. Their control spanned
      for many miles across several continents, but most indicate that they were based in the northern continent known
      as Laronia. The humans and the elves weren't the only major races on this continent though. The proud orcs
      inhabited the great savannahs, the hardy dwarves in the mountains and the enigmatic gnomes. They were not treated
      well by the mighty and magical humans or elves though. The orcs were enslaved by the humans, oppressed and looked
      upon like less than dirt. The dwarves were very skilled with metalwork and had access to rare metals within their
      mountains, but the magical skills of the elves and humans would surpass the quality that the dwarves could
      produce. As a result they would keep to their fortresses and cities and rarely deal with the arrogant magicians.
      Very little is known about where the gnomes originated from, but record do show that they lived in the same
      regions as the humans and elves. They weren't treated as poorly as orcs, but they were still looked upon as
      sub-creatures compared to the arcane races.

      A large, world changing event happened several thousands of years ago, but the exact details are yet to be found
      in the records of old. Many sages and researches have pieced together ruined and incomplete logs and pieced
      together a theory that most seem to agree with and believe in. Something the races had done had angered the gods,
      causing them to leave the mortal races to themselves. They took away the blessings from the humans and elves, but
      also stripped the mortal races of their ability to manipulate the arcane energies of the world. The human and
      elven empires would quickly crumble. The orcs would revolt, striking back at those who had enslaved them for
      centuries, or even millenia. The dwarves would also plan to take the human and elven regions from them while they
      would still be recovering from their loss of magic. They would lay detailed and strategic plans, but they took
      a long time to establish a proper assault. By the time they launched their attack the orcs had already taken over
      larger regions of the elves and humans, but they still weren't going to give up on their plans. They had superior
      technology and materials to work with, and would launch their attacks on the orcs while the elves and humans would
      flee from their regions.

    <p>
      The battle between the orcs and the dwarves was vicious as their side wanted to give up the now freed up regions
      of the arcane races.However the dwarves did indeed have much better technology than the orcs,even if the orcs
      had numbers and unmatched ferocity. The orcs would need to retreat, giving up a lot of territory until the leaders
      of the rebellion were able to launch a strong enough counterattack to drive the dwarves back. Both sides would
      fall back to recuperate, but this would be the start of a never-ending war between the orcs and dwarves. The
      gnomes who had lived in the human and elven regions would not join either side of the war, but rather just
      integrate into the societies that took over the regions they lived in. The gnomes became quite integral for the
      growth of both sides.They were able to travel between the orcish and dwarven regions, opening up black markets
      and secret trading routes. Both orcs and dwarves would make use of these gnomish traders. Many didn't want a war
      and simply wanted to trade, while others used the war as an opportunity to improve their sales.

      During this period of history, which has been called Post Exodus of the Gods, the races had to make due without
      much forms of magic. Even though the humans and elves had been superior over all other races when it came to
      weaving arcane energies, the other races still had the capabilities in the past, but no longer. Only the most
      devout of the gods would be able to communicate with the deities who had chosen to reside in the background of the
      planes. Still, most races would rely on mundane methods when it came to rebuilding their civilisations and keeping
      order. After many centuries of rebuilding and expanding the orcs and dwarves had taken over most of the old human
      and elven territories. They still were at war with each other, but each side was able to prosper. It is assumed
      that other races of the world were also able to prosper despite losing their arcane abilities, but there are few
      records of this. The only other race which has some form of records from this time period is the race known as
      the Azzinth.

    <p>
      The Azzinth are said to be descendants of fiends. The Azzinth themselves don't share their origins with others,
      but it is unsure if that is due to them wanting to protect some important secret or if they just don't know.
      Regardless of their origin they still resemble their assumed fiendish origins; skin in the colours of red, black,
      gray or in rare cases blue, often horns of various shapes and sizes and usually a strong tail. They are said to
      have first appeared in the Azzin desert, but it is uncertain how long ago that was. The Azzinth still have
      enough records to prove that they had a sizable empire when the Exodus first struck and that they also lost
      their arcane abilities when they struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Exodus lasted for several centuries, but another world shattering event would also occur. Towards the end of
      the post Exodus era many civilisations would have grown quite large, and technology had advanced by quite a lot.
      While not at the levels of the magical human or elven empires, the orcs and dwarves would have been forces to
      reckon with even for the arcane races.There is however one thing that is common between the orcs, the dwarves and
      the Azzinth. Not many years before the second world changing event, all empires discovered some powerful relics
      that have become known as Magistones. These stones were essentially ley energy given physical shape; pure
      arcane energies laying dormant hidden in several places across the world. All these civilisations would try to
      use or exploit these Magistones, try to regain the arcane abilities that their ancestors were rumoured to have.
      It is not certain what exactly would trigger the next event, but it still happened. Five centuries ago,
      the Magistones exploded, sending out immense destructive arcane waves across the entire realm and nearly
      completely destroying all forms of civilization.
